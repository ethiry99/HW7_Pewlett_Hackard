# HW Pewlett Hackard (Module 7 Challenge)

## Overview

#### As the employee population at Pewlett Hackard has people reaching retirement age a significant number of people will be leaving the company.  These people will take with them a vast amount a knowledge and experience.  The reduction in head count will cause a need for hiring campaigns and wide spread training.  This analysis will help determine what is needed to sustain a qualified workforce.

## Results

* #### The number of retirement eligibile employees is over 72,000.  

* #### The Senior Staff and Senior Engineer job titles make up over 2/3 of the retirments.

* #### The Mentorship pool is about 1500 employees.

* #### On average the retirees have been in there present position since April, of 1996.

## Summary

#### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Over 72,000 roles will need to be replaced assuming current staffing levels will remain consistent in the future.  This may be a good time to determine if all of the positions are required going forward.  Few things are more dangerous to an organization than blindly doing things the way they always have been done without evaluating what is best for today's business climate.

#### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
With about 1500 mentorship possibilities there are not enough poeple in their human resources pipeline to fill the 72,000 plus expected openings.  Maybe widening the criteria for the mentorship program would help in filling those positions but more drastic measures are likely needed.

### Additional Insights

* #### The Development, Production and Sales Departments account for over 60% of the expected retirees.  These departments will need to be especially vigilant to be ready for the upcoming shift.

* #### Expanding the mentorship to include employees born in 1964 has a dramatic increase in the potential number of employees involved.  The number increases from about 1500 to nearly 20,000.  More will nbeed to be done to fill the shoes of retirees but that is a nice first step!
